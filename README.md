## Introduction

The Hangman is a guessing game, testing the users knowledge and vocabulary. Player has to complete the word by picking correct letters. This project was created as a part of milestone project 2 (Bristol college/Code institute) Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development. 
Educational purposes only.

### History

Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894 called Birds, Beasts, and Fishes.[1] This version lacks the image of a hanged man, instead relying on keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill in the blanks.

A version which incorporated hanging imagery was described in a 1902 article in The Philadelphia Inquirer, which stated that it was popular at "White Cap" parties hosted by Vigilance Committees where guests would wear "white peaked caps with masks"
